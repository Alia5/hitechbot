Browser addon Bot for [https://matchup.hitech-gamer.com/game/start](https://matchup.hitech-gamer.com/game/start)

---

Written mostly for fun, I didn't intend to actually compete in the challenge.

Hitech didn't even obfuscate their javascript-code, which was rather an invitation to create this.  
This code has been released after the challenge was finished.  

## Building

`$ npm run build`

## Usage

Simply install the addon and once on the game page, click the start bot button
