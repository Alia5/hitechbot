Written mostly for fun, I didn't intend to actually compete in the challenge.

Hitech didn't even obfuscate their javascript-code, which was rather an invitation to create this.  
This code has been released after the challenge was over.  

Sadly though, cou cannot actually see it in action now :(

## Building

`$ npm i && npm run devbuild`

## Usage

Load unpacked chrome extension (enable developer mode) from `dist` folder.  
point your browser to [https://matchup.hitech-gamer.com/game/start](https://matchup.hitech-gamer.com/game/start)  
`Run the game bicthes!`
